# Examples in the StrainPanDA manuscript

## rds files in the R_objects folder

All the rds files generated by StrainPanDA of the examples in the manuscript were provided.
An rds file contains all the features generated by StrainPanDA, rather than just the composition matrix in the csv format. 
The guideline of rds file usage and the detailed list of rds files are [here](https://github.com/xbiome/StrainPanDA/blob/main/example/R_objects/README.md).

## Codes for figure generation in the Figures folders

Codes for each result figure (including supplementary) of the manuscript were provided.
The list of code files is [here](https://github.com/xbiome/StrainPanDA/blob/main/example/Figures/README.md).
